### Description

Your task is to prepare a 10 minute group presentation for a technical business audience.

Remember: you're working as a data scientist for a contracting firm that's rapidly expanding. Your principal thinks the best way to gauge salary amounts is to take a look at what industry factors influence the pay scale for these professionals.

So your principal wants both to understand:
- which factors seem to influence pay and,
- wants to be able to predict expected salaries for listings that omit salary, to be used in negotiations

Assume that your principal has experience with data science, so be prepared to justify your findings! But also remember that you were tasked with solving a business problem.


### Requirements

- 10 minute group presentation. All team members must speak!
- Deck in googleslides submitted via slack to John by 1:30pm on Friday.


### Groups

Below are the teams. You will have Thursday morning and Friday morning, 9-10am, to work on this.  Presentations take place on Friday afternoon.

Group 1: TBD<br>
Group 2: TBD<br>
Group 3: TBD<br>
Group 4: TBD<br>

Within your group, you all may have taken different approaches to the project. Try to synthesize as much as possible, choose the best parts, and produce a cohesive group presentation.
